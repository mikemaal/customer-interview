The target of this exercise is to know the number of users of each domain address.
The task should take about 2 hours.

Spending more time I think that a different aproximation could be done to solve the problem in large files. With the current aproximation, solve the problem depends on the machine capacity.

For large files:
Creating an extra file sorting first by domain and then by user simplify the task of counting users per domain taking into account repeated inputs and without keeping in memory the usernames.
This kind of sorting in golang is something to work on it and with the whole problem it would take me more time that was expected.
Also there is other ways of sorting files like sort in unix but it is something depending on the OS.
